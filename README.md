# HFCN: Learning Hierarchical Fields via Capsule Networks for Click-Through Rate Prediction
The code is based on [DeepCTR](https://github.com/shenweichen/DeepCTR), which helps us to keep the common module (MLP, LR, prediction layer) in the same. All the experiments are tested on Tensorflow 2.2.
## Dataset
We implemented our experiments on three pulic datasets:
* Criteo: [avaliable at]()
* Avazu: [avaliable at]()
* MovieLens-1M: [avaliable at]()
We provide our data preprocess code
